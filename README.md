[![CI](https://github.com/ansible-collections/REPONAMEHERE/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ansible-collections/REPONAMEHERE/actions) [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/REPONAMEHERE)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/REPONAMEHERE)

<!-- Describe the collection and why a user would want to use it. What does the collection do? -->

This is a collection of roles for RHV Provision, Satellite and IDM registration and VM configuration.

## Release Process
This collection uses an auatomated GitHub workflow to publish releases to Ansible Galaxy. This workflow can be found in `.github/workflows/galaxy-release.yml`. It is dependent on `release.yml` and `galaxy.yml.j2`. See instructions below for usage.

To publish a release to Galaxy:
1) An administrator of the repository must configure a secret in the settings containing the API key for the Galaxy namespace. The secret should be called `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_APIKEY`. This is a one time step.
2) To publish a release, click "releases" at the top of repository home page and "Draft a new release"
3) The "Tag version" should be in the form `v#.#.#`. A suffix may be added such as `-dev#` or `rc#` for pre-releases. These will still publish to Galaxy but will not be chosen when installing `latest`. The version must be explicitly stated when installing to use pre-releases.
4) Title the release, it is recommended to use the "Tag version"
5) Clicking "Publish release" will initiate the workflow. If there are no errors building the collection, it will be automatically published to galaxy as the version suppied for "Tag version"

## Tested with Ansible

## External requirements

This collection depends on the awx.collection since it uses the modules there.

### Supported connections
<!-- Optional. If your collection supports only specific connection types (such as HTTPAPI, netconf, or others), list them here. -->

## Included content
